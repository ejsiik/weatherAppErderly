# Weather App
This is a weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather data for a given location. 
The app displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition of the given location.

## Usage
To use the app, simply download or clone the repository and open the code in any android emulator e.g. Android Studio.

Please note that you need to replace the API_KEY variable in the weather_normal.kt and weather_old.kt file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key for the app to work.
You can get an API key by registering for an account on the https://openweathermap.org/.

The app also includes an elderly mode that changes the view for elderly people. 
To switch to elderly mode, simply click the "Elderly Mode" button on the top right corner of the app.
